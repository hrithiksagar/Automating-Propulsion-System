Thrust Basics: 
# pro                  peller : Latin
  forward/backward     Drive
Thrust = basically pulling or pushing
Thrust = Mechanical + Propulsive Force
this depends on : Amount of gas moved and Velocity

Higher thrusts can be generated by = accelerating Large Mass of gases by small amount
this is the most efficient method


Goal of Aircraft engine = 
1.  Thrust form PS must maintain balance while its cruising
2.  That thrust must exceed the "Drag"(Friction) of the plane for it to accelerate

excess thrust = Thrust - Drag
 More excess thrust faster Plane accelerate
Thrust Depends on : amount of gas moved and Velocity

Q) How does thrusing work in Aeroplanes?
Ans)    SUPERSONIC DE LAVAL NOZZEL
simply: Rocket Engine (Properller Nozzel Rocket Engine)
Concept: Expands and accelearte combusition gases by burning Propellants (Chemical substances, which are used to create Movements of the FLUID)
--> this is done so that exhaust gases exit at the Nozzel at Hyper Sonic Velocities!
Simply:
Rocket generats high pressure
i.e almost 100s of ATPs
process: 
static high pressure --> high temp gas --> Rapidly Moving gas at near ambiend pressure

Velocity = 1 / 
            / Pressure            this is to keep mass rate constant

Rocket nozzel = CD Nozzel (Converging Diverging)
