Attributes:
Propulsion System = PS
----------------------------------------------------
Propulsive
pro                  peller : Latin
forward/backward     Drive
Thrust = basically pulling or pushing
Thrust = Mechanical + Propulsive Force

Goal of Aircraft engine = 
1.  Thrust form PS must maintain balance while its cruising
2.  That thrust must exceed the "Drag"(Friction) of the plane for it to accelerate

excess thrust = Thrust - Drag
 More excess thrust faster Plane accelerate
Thrust Depends on : amount of gas moved and Velocity
