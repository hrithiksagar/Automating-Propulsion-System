Context

Testing hardware to qualify it for Spaceflight is critical to model, and verify performances. Hot fire tests (also known as life-tests) are typically run during the qualification campaigns of satellite thrusters, but results remains proprietary data. This synthetic dataset was generated based on real-world physics of monopropellant chemical thruster, to foster the development and benchmarking of transient, and steady-state modelling.

Content

Each file is a time series of 1-hour long fire test run for a specific inlet propellant pressure (between 8 and 24 bar).
The thruster is operated with a single ON-OFF command. The status of the command is provided in the ton column.
The thrust and mfr columns are respectively the measured thrust (in Newtons) and measured mass flow rate (in mg/s) recorded at 100 Hz frequency.

The file format provides the following information: for example "SN01 _ 10 _1 7.csv":

the thruster fired is SN01 (all fire tests were performed on the same thruster "SN01" (for serial number 01)).
the firing sequence was run with an inlet pressure of 10 bar.
the single test ID (chronological) is 17.
Evolutions

Future versions on the dataset may include tests run on different serial numbers, from which you will be able to assess the thruster-to-thruster reproducibility.
